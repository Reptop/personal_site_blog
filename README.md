# What this project is
This project is for my personal website, which will show my portfolio; the website will also include my blog, where I will talk about my life and whatever I want periodically. The website will have its own domain, but I have yet to figure out the domain name yet.

# Plan
- The website will be built via React
- Will include dynamic animations 
- Will actually be visually pleasing
- Will have an actual blog component to it
- Mobile support
